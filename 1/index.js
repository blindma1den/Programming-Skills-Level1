// 1. Manchester United FC has hired you as a developer. Develop a program that helps the coach identify their fastest player, player with the most goals, assists, passing accuracy, and defensive involvements.
// The system should also allow comparison between two players. Use the following player profiles:

// Bruno Fernandes: 5 goals, 6 points in speed, 9 points in assists, 10 points in passing accuracy, 3 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 8.
// Rasmus Hojlund: 12 goals, 8 points in speed, 2 points in assists, 6 points in passing accuracy, 2 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 11.
// Harry Maguire: 1 goal, 5 points in speed, 1 point in assists, 7 points in passing accuracy, 9 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 5.
// Alejandro Garnacho: 8 goals, 7 points in speed, 8 points in assists, 6 points in passing accuracy, 0 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 17.
// Mason Mount: 2 goals, 6 points in speed, 4 points in assists, 8 points in passing accuracy, 1 defensive involvement. Corresponds to jersey number 7.
// The program functions as follows: The coach accesses the system and encounters a menu with the following options:

// Player Review: By entering the player's jersey number, they can access the player's characteristics.
// Compare two players: The system prompts for two jersey numbers and displays the data of both players on screen.
// Identify the fastest player: Displays the player with the most points in speed.
// Identify the top goal scorer: Displays the player with the most points in goals.
// Identify the player with the most assists: Displays the player with the most points in assists.
// Identify the player with the highest passing accuracy: Displays the player with the most points in passing accuracy.
// Identify the player with the most defensive involvements: Displays the player with the most points in defensive involvements.
// The system should also allow returning to the main menu.
