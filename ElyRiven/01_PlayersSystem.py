# 1. Manchester United FC has hired you as a developer. Develop a program that helps the coach identify their fastest player, player with the most goals, assists, passing accuracy, and defensive involvements.
# The system should also allow comparison between two players. Use the following player profiles:

# Bruno Fernandes: 5 goals, 6 points in speed, 9 points in assists, 10 points in passing accuracy, 3 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 8.
# Rasmus Hojlund: 12 goals, 8 points in speed, 2 points in assists, 6 points in passing accuracy, 2 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 11.
# Harry Maguire: 1 goal, 5 points in speed, 1 point in assists, 7 points in passing accuracy, 9 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 5.
# Alejandro Garnacho: 8 goals, 7 points in speed, 8 points in assists, 6 points in passing accuracy, 0 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 17.
# Mason Mount: 2 goals, 6 points in speed, 4 points in assists, 8 points in passing accuracy, 1 defensive involvement. Corresponds to jersey number 7.
# The program functions as follows: The coach accesses the system and encounters a menu with the following options:

# Player Review: By entering the player's jersey number, they can access the player's characteristics.
# Compare two players: The system prompts for two jersey numbers and displays the data of both players on screen.
# Identify the fastest player: Displays the player with the most points in speed.
# Identify the top goal scorer: Displays the player with the most points in goals.
# Identify the player with the most assists: Displays the player with the most points in assists.
# Identify the player with the highest passing accuracy: Displays the player with the most points in passing accuracy.
# Identify the player with the most defensive involvements: Displays the player with the most points in defensive involvements.
# The system should also allow returning to the main menu.
